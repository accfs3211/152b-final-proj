TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.014 ns between lfsr_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and questionNum_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
